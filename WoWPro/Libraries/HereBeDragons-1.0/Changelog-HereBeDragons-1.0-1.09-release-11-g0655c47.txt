Hendrik Leppkes:
	- Re-use data tables for pins when an existing pin is re-added to move it.
	This avoids excess table creation which bypassed the internal table cache.
	- Protect against errors during loading when no unit position is available.
	- Fix handling of micro dungeons on transformed continents
	- Add feral druid artifact scenario override
	- Add instance override for the Karazhan Artifact Scenario
	- Dalaran Underbelly has its own instance ID, apparently.
	- Properly handle map levels in 7.0
	GetNumDungeonMapLevels() now returns a list of available map levels instead of
	a total count.
	- Add instance override for the Temple of Elune Scenario in Val'sharah
	- Add a fallback for GetNumDungeonMapLevels, which can return nil on the Legion Alpha.
	Minor intentionally not bumped since this change is only needed on the alpha,
	but would need a full data update to take effect, which would only add overhead on live.
	
	Reported by Gethe and MysticalOS on IRC, fix tested by MysticalOS.
	- Add the confirmed Draenor zone finale scenarios to the instance overrides
	- Add the proper Garrison Level 2 instance IDs
	Fixes ticket 5.
