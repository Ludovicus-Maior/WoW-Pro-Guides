A Basic Botany|QID|28733|M|33.53,49.35|N|If you'd like to do the Peacebloom vs. Ghouls quest line, now is an excellent time. It's a fun side-quest that rewards a Singing Sunflower vanity pet at the end. If you want to do it, follow the arrow and accept the quest "Basic Botany." THEN close this step. Otherwise, close this step without accepting the quest.|
C Basic Botany|QID|28733|N|Right-click the glowing orbs to collect Solar Power. Place Spitters (button 1) in the center lane whenever you can.|O|

C Flower Power|QID|28617|N|The undead will come through the 3 center lanes this time. You have time to plant 3 Sunflowers in the back column before anything else. Follow that with 2 columns of Spitters. After you unlock Freezyas, build a column of them as well. This will be enough to win the round.|O|

C Ghouls Hate My Grains|QID|28744|N|Plant your 3 sunflowers, then put a rocknut in the path of the first ghoul, then a spitter to kill that ghoul. After that, you're free to finish out 2 columns of sunflowers, filling spitters in column and 3 freezyas in column 4 as needed. After filling these columns, add more spitters, rocknuts and vines as needed in columns 5-7. Do not plant in column 8, as this can cause the quest to bug.|O|

C Someone Setup the Pumpkin Bomb|QID|28747|N|Use the same basic strategy as the last round--columns 1-2 full of sunflowers, 3 full of spitters, and 4 full of freezyas, then more spitters, rocknuts, and vines for the rest. This wave is difficult, and you will spend a lot of time replacing holes in your rocknut and vine columns. Drop pumpkin bombs as often as possible when the abominations begin to appear.|O|

C Lawn of the Dead|QID|28748|N|Start with the usual pattern for your first four columns, with rocknuts in column 5. Stop to collect solar power after this. When Warden Stillwater appears, use Pumpkin Bombs to take him down; 5 should do it, but make sure he's stopped and facing left before you use them. Replace plants that are killed by his blight flasks. This is an easy win after the last round.|O|
