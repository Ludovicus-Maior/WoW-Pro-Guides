N How to use this Guide|QID|13418|N|This guide includes many 5-Man Quests. It is unlikely that you will find a random group for those since the release of Cataclysm, but you can easily solo most of them once your character wears Cataclysm-Gear. If you already have a full equipment from any of the Cataclysm zones, you can try to do them solo, if you don't, just skip those Quests.|
