;The original guide was written by Xicon, who gave permission for it to be coded into Tour Guide form, and was coded and modified by Jiyambi. This newest revision(2011) added Northrend and Cataclysm, and other changes to bring it into our current Wow-Pro format.

N About this Guide|QID|9339|N|This guide assumes you are at least lvl 60 so you can fly or have all the relevant flight paths. Often using your own flying mount will be more efficient, but the flighpaths are left in so you can fly/afk if needed. BE SURE TO CHECK OFF the "fly" steps off if you want to fly on your own, or else the arrows point to the nearest flight master. Keep in mind that about half of this holiday requires you to perform actions which flag you as PvP, so even on a PvE realm you will probably see some PvP action. You may want to leave your gear in the bank, in case you need to rez at the spirit healer.|

N Before you start...|QID|9339|N|Make sure you have your hearth set to Orgrimmar or Shrine of the Two Moons, as we will be using it to quickly get from place to place.

N Ranks|QID|9339|N|Rank 2 will leave out the Alliance City Fires, setting to Rank 1 will only do the intro quests and Pandaria.|

R Orgrimmar|QID|9339|N|Head to Orgrimmar if you are not there already. The dailies and other intro quests are also available in Thunder Bluff, Silvermoon and Undercity.|

Nearby there are a set of burning pedestals with a hunter's mark jumping between them. Throw torches at the pedestal that has the mark on it until you complete the quest.|

C Torch Catching|QID|11923|M|47.1,38.1|Z|Orgrimmar|U|34833|N|Use the unlit torch next to the fire and follow it's shadow. Stay under the shadow and you will automatically catch and throw the torch. Keep it up until you've done it 4 times in a row - this can be frustrating if there are lots of people around, but keep trying! If you have a lot of trouble, wait and do it in Thunder Bluff when we go there.|
T Torch Catching|RANK|2|QID|11923|M|47.1,38.1|Z|Orgrimmar|N|To the Master Flame Eater.|

N Dailies|QID|11926|N|You've now unlocked two dailies, More Torch Tossing and More Torch Catching. If you want both the brazier (a toy) and the battle pet, you should do these every day of the fire festival in order to earn enough blossoms.|

C More Torch Catching|RANK|2|QID|11925|U|34833|N|Use the unlit torch next to the fire and follow it's shadow. Stay under the shadow and you will automatically catch and throw the torch. Keep it up until you've done it 10 times in a row - this can be frustrating if there are lots of people around, I personally find it more effort than its worth and usually skip it.|

Unless you have stealth, this will probably be a corpse hopping situation, so you may want to remove your gear. In addition, if this holiday is like the others this year, people will probably be on the lookout and ready to snipe those trying to complete these achievements. You can either try to sneak around the edges of the city, or just run straight through the forge at the center.|
