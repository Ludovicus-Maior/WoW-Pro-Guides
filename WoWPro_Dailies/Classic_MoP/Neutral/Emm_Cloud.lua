N Onyx To Goodness|QID|31784|N|if you don't want to do dailies skip the pickup quests steps and following that is a step with all the potential egg spawns marked.  TIP: find someone on a low pop realm to invite you there to search for eggs.|

;these could be sticky...but too many sticky steps clutter the window (and to quote Thomas the Tank, add 'confusion and delay'.
C Dig - Fragments of the Past|QID|30147|P|Archaeology;794;525|M|44.93,73.36|NC|N|Find a digsite, dig. If you have a patient archeologist friend, you can do this even if your acheology isn't high enough, friend digs, and you kill the mobs in the imediate area can drop these too(particularly those that spawn upon picking up an artifact), you can abandon the quest or manually check this step off if you aren't going to do it.|
C Fish - Snack Time|QID|30146|NC|N|Any fish caught may catch a sugar minnow while on this quest.|
C Cook - A feast for the Senses|NC|QID|30149|N|Cook 5 fish cakes - requires 10 golden carp (or get them from someone else).|
