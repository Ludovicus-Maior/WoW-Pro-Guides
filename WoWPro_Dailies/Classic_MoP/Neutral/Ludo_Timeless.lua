C The Secret Ingredient Is...|QID|33027|N|If you have addons that mess up the vehicle UI, you had better disable them for this scenario. You also want NPC health bars on.\nThe strategy is simple. There are 3 kinds of customers: Scholars like #1 soup. Merchants like #2 soup. Farmers like #3).\nThe customers will line up.  You need to start the soup for the customer, right click on them and then an empty chair to seat them and then when the soup is done, click on it and then the customer.\n Red bellies mean they are hungry and will want seconds. Timers above their heads indicate impatience. Clicking too fast will give an error.\n Goal: Finish with<5 unsatisfied customers. Talk to Sungshin to start the solo-scenario.|
