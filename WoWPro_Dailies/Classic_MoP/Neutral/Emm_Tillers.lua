N The Tillers Rep Bar|QID|30252|N|Open the Reputation UI (<U> key by default) and click on the 'The Tillers'. In the window that opens, check the box beside 'Show as Experience Bar'./nThis will display your current reputation level with The Tillers as a bar directly above the XP bar.|
N Dark Soil|QID|30535|N|While you're flying about doing your dailies, (not just these dailies) keep an eye out for Dark Soil. It contains a Lost Treasure you can turn in for "Friendship" Rep with the various friends around the farm.|
N Lost Treasure|QID|30535|N|There are 5 Lost treasures: Blue Feather, Jade Cat, Marsh Lily' Ruby Shard, and Lovely Apple. Each friend has a favorite Lost Treasure that you can give to them with no daily limit (900 Friendship per item). All of the friends will accept non-favorite Lost Treasure for a lesser amount (540 Friendship). So, unless you are maxed out with the friend who prefers that specific item, it's much better to give it to the friend who prefers it.\nI've tried to note which Lost Treasure they prefer for most interactions with the friends.\nEvery Lost Treasure has 2 friends that prefer it; but, only 1 Lost Treasure is preferred by each friend.|
N Favorite Food|QID|30535|N|Each friend has a favorite food that you can only give to them once per day (1,800 Friendship).\nIf you can't remember which food they like, you can mouseover the friend rep bar (in the gossip pane) to be reminded.\nIt's probably a good idea to keep an eye on your Friendship level as you hand them in.|P|Cooking;185;4+25| ; Assumes they have recipes due to cooking skill level
N Cooking|AVAILABLE|31311|N|The favorite meals for the various friends require Pandaren Cuisine (The Way of...) lv 25. If you plan on cooking the food yourself, you'll need the Cooking skill and the recipes. The Pandarian Cooking guide will get you these recipes.|JUMP|Pandaren Cooking|P|Cooking;185;4+0| ; They do not have Cooking Skill
N Pandaren Cooking guide|AVAILABLE|31311|N|The Pandaren Cooking guide will get you to where you need to be.|JUMP|Pandaren Cooking|P|Cooking;185;4+25;1| ; They have the Cooking skill started but may not have the recipes required.
N Available Quests|QID|30535|N|Because quests are given at various Friendship levels and Tiller Rep levels, you can accept a quest whenever you see it; whether or not the guide tells you to (Except the daily turn in of Lost Treasure as discussed earlier). Those will be designated by a blue "?" instead of a blue "!".|
N Two locations|QID|30535|N|Every day, two friends will be at the Halfhill Market for the day instead of at The Heartland (Unless they 'live' at the Market) They will offer you a daily quest. The coordinates to each friend's location will be to their usual location.\n[color=FF0000]NOTE: [/color]Gina and Jogu will always be at the Market; they only have one location.|
N One-time Quests|QID|30535|N|Most of the friends offer various, one-time quests based on your Friendship level with them (Stranger/Acquaintance/Buddy/Friend/Good Friend/Best Friend). There is no immediate need to finish the quests; unless you're turning in lots of Dark Soil treasures. If that's the case, turn in the quest first before doing the treasures.\n[color=FF0000]NOTE: [/color]You'll want to keep an eye on your Friendship levels as you do your turn-ins to avoid wasting items. Your Friendship level is displayed at the top of the chat window with each friend.|
N Growing the Farm|QID|30535|N|To unlock more farming plots, accept and complete the "Growing the Farm" quests from Farmer Yoon as soon as you can.|
N RANK|QID|30257|N|Do the guide on Rank 2 if you want to skip the share food with the friends quests, Set to Rank 1 if you also want to skip the cooking quests.|
N Quick Method|QID|30527|N|Shortest time to exalted. If you have the bonus faction commendation on your account, you can get to exalted very quickly. The main limiting thing is the quests that require you to plant, harvest and deliver produce to obtain the votes. If you plant the item(s) in advance of receiving the quest, you can then harvest after you have the quest and then replant for the quest credit. (After replanting you can dig up and plant something else). Preplanting before you have the quest shaves a day off for each one (i.e. 4 days)off of the time it takes to get to exalted. You will also need to gain about 2K extra faction beyond the quests to finish in 4 days. If you are >= level 90, this can be from a random Pandaria dungeon or scenario while *championing* the Tillers faction. If you are >=level 90 you 100 from each harvest, but also need to purchasing commendations from Mistweaver Xia on Timeless Isle (50 timewarped badges/300 faction) or an extra day or two of dailies.|REP|The Tillers;1272;Neutral;bonus|
N Championing|QID|30252|N|To champion a faction in Pandaria, you click on the star to the left of the reputation's name in your character's reputation panel. Then the first random Pandaria dungeon and/or scenario you do each day will yield you bonus rep with that faction.|
N Quick method - Day 1|QID|31945|M|52.02,48.30|N|Plant 1 scallion and 2 carrot seeds as soon as you are able.|U|80591|REP|The Tillers;1272;honored-revered;bonus|

This will have earned you enough rep to get the quests to open the 3rd plot. If you are not championing or otherwise getting extra faction, delay a day. Plant 3 cabbages and 3 Witchberries.|U|80591|NC|PRE|31945|REP|The Tillers;1272;honored-revered;bonus|

After harvesting, you can plant 3 cabbage, When you get Nana's vote quest, Harvest the Witchberries and plant 3 more. Plant 4 striped melons. If you didn't have enough faction to get the vote quests, harvest for the faction benefit and replant the same thing for tomorrow.|U|79102|NC|PRE|31946|REP|The Tillers;1272;honored-revered;bonus|
