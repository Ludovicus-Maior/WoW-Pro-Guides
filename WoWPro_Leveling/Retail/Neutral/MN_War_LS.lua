Go ahead and grab the newest release. That has all the changes. I will need a Horde Rank 1, and Rank 3 run through of just Waking Shore. If you wouldnt mind using a google sheets.

Finished my runthroughs. Only a few minor suggestions. The guide is very clear and complete, imho. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cGK3p-0w23D9vr-QVjEOZOtQY7HEJGTQrV3n86v6tWA/edit?usp=sharing

I don't feel able to effectively weave in the side quests, but I'll keep chugging through the main quests to help out.

Here's the side quests for Harandar. I did them in the order for the Achievement "Sojourner of Harandar" so I could keep it straight and not miss anything. It is not at all optimized.

Not a problem at all
Getting the quests on the paper is more work then rearranging them
I can slide wuests into spots in a matter of mins, it takes hours getting everything recorded
Khonar — 11/30/2025 2:23 PM
I used ; for comments with blank lines to separate each sub-part for visual clarity.

Sounds good appreciate all the help
Khonar — 11/30/2025 2:24 PM
I'm hanging at my inlaws for the holiday and don't have much to do 🙂
been using this since it was Jame's Leveling Guide back in TBC, it feels good to help out

Ya Unfortionatly we lost a lot of our authors back in shadowlands, so we are only a small team now. With the amount of content that’s being pushed by blizzard now it’s hard to keep up
Khonar — 11/30/2025 3:03 PM
Do you happen to know if anyone else is working on Sojourner for Zul'Aman or Voidstorm? I caan do one of those next but don't need to duplicate the efforts of others
Cagomei

 — 11/30/2025 3:03 PM
I am the only one working on beta atm
Khonar — 11/30/2025 3:03 PM
okie doke, I'll do them in that sequence then
Cagomei

 — 11/30/2025 3:03 PM
And I’m working on Eversong
I have sojourner recorded but I’m trying to stream line it now

I didn't bother copying the header this time since it'll all be cut & paste. For some reason i did all the things but didn't get the achievement. Should probably report that bug
Cagomei

 — 11/30/2025 8:17 PM
Probably
Thank u again

It was, once again, my pleasure to be of assistance. However, doing 2 in one day was a bit much. It might be a bit before I do the Voidstorm one.

No rush at all. Thanks again for all the help
