C The Ballad of Maximillian|QID|24707|Z|78; Un'goro Crater|N|Immediately start using ability 1 on cooldown - it generates rocks. Once the actual fight starts, only use it when the devilsaur is within range for the stun. You can and should spam ability 2, the rock throw, as long as you have rocks (once the devilsaur fight starts). You should get pieces of armor to throw from Max now and then, which will be ability #3. Make sure to only start attacking the Devilsaur Queen after it starts chasing you, it may bug if you attack before hand and Max won't hand you armor (may still bug even then).|
