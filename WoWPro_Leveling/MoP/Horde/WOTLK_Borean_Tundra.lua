N READ THIS |QID|11592|N|The quest from Longrunner Proudhoof is an escort. It composes of two ambushes; the first can be difficult if you aggro too many, the second is easy, and a fight against an elite, like usual, let the NPC tank. You won't have time to loot, so just eat/drink as fast as possible when you have a chance. Go back and loot the bodies afterwards.|
