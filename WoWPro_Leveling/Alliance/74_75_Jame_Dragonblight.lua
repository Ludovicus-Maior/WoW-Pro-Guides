He periodically casts Pulsing Shards. This is very dangerous and can't be interrupted. Either run away while he channels it or use something like cloak of shadows, divine shield, ice block.|

The maggots are immune to AoE abilities, so you'd have to target them and kill them one by one (they have 1000HP). By the time you'd be done with that, he'd summon another round of maggots.
